this is a sample test directory

assuming HHSYM=TRUE

the input files required are 
input.txt        WAVR4 or WAVR4.SYM
inp.txt          transform
inp.dipole.txt   DIPOLE

which produce these output files respectively

out.dipole.txt
output.txt
out.txt

Wave-function computation and transformation to primitive basis can be done by running 
initiate.sh  
followed by dipole moment calculation
or altogether by
run.sh
