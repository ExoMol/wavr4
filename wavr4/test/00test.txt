Test acetylene calculation J=1

Potential function for acetylene is based on
Halonen, Child, Carter, Mol. Phys. 1982 v47 p1097
which is an update for potetial1.f90 based on
Carter, Mills, Murrell, Mol. Phys. 1980 v41 p191

How to run the test:

1. assume you have created ~/wavr4 directory.
   copy the file potential.f90 to the root wavr4 directory
   (i.e. ~/wavr4 ) and run make there
2. cd test and run ../main.exe
3. the program creates a number of data files x????-K?-?.dat
   (these can be re-used), temporary h6.dat file and the
   output file output.txt

The calculation takes 100 MB RAM and 75 MB of disk space
Time: about 10 min on both 667 MHz Alpha Tru64 and Sun Blade 2000
